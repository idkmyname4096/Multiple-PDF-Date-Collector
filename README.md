# Multiple-PDF-Date-Collector
Originally made to help my brother collect dates across 2000+ newspapers on an online archive.
PDF -> .txt
Searches for dates in format DD-MM-YYYY with support for multiple ways of representing the month (Jan/January for example).
Outputs to txt file in a format compatible with being copy pasted into a csv spreadsheet.
Automatically collates identical dates and includes dates with 0 appearances between the earliest and the latest date that appear.
